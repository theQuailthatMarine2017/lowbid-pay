This Nodejs module generates bearer auth token for both production and sandbox environments allowing users who need to make use of the mpesa api to quickly generator their bearer token without too much  hassle setting up manually. 

Mpesa Requires an Auth header with every call to the api with a value of Bearer [Token];

The token is generated by creating a base64string from your consumer key and consumer secret and sending it to the endpoint that returns your bearer token.

NB: Bearer tokens for sandbox environment expire after certain period of time so remeber to run this module again once it expires.

There is a CLI client available on github https://github.com/theQuailthatMarine2017/NodeJS-MPESA-Bearer-Token-Generator--CLI which allows you to pass environment, consumerKey & consumerSecret as arguments when running the application and using this package to generate the token.

Just git clone the above repo, install dependancies, pass the arguments and run the node app.

NB: PLEASE FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS ON GITHUB LINK FOR MORE DETAILS.
